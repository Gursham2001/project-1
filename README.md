# SITH INVADERS

## Overview 
Sith Invaders the first project of the course in Front-End Development.  
  
The task was to create a Grid-game using the traditional vanilla Javascript, Css and HTML.  
  
We were given a choice of games to choose from and instantly i chose Space invaders, for the raw fact Its a popular arcade game and I could style it in a Star Wars theme, I used the star wars force tune to put the player in the Star Wars enviroment.
  
This Project really helped put what i had learned into practice and to be able to link the creative side of me to the logical side of Javascript, HTML and Css.
